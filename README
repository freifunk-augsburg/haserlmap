This simple haserl script can be used to show the decentral freifunk map
on every webserver that support haserl. The data for the map can either be
downloaded from nodes with luci and the decentral map installed or directly
from a local latlon_file. This latlon_file can be written by the the
olsrd nameservice plugin.

Depencies: haserl, wget

The javascript code is taken from the decentral map app in the luci
webinterface: http://luci.subsignal.org and uses the same license
